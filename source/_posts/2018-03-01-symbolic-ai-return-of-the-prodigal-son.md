**What is Symbolic AI ?** 

We humans, represent the world around us through high level concepts. For example, the word 'Man', it stands for something, in this case a biological entity that has certain properties.  Similarly words like 'Trees' , 'Flowers', 'Skyscrapers' are symbols that stand for something or someone. It might sound like I am explaining the trivial, however, it is important to grok this idea to understand the essence of Symbolic AI. Now, lets analyse this statement that dates back to ancient Rome, "All men are mortal;  Caius is a man; therefore Caius is mortal. " Here we associated mortality with all men, thus deducing Caius is also mortal,since he is a man. This is the essence of symbolic AI, reasoning through relationships among high level concepts. But its quite labour intensive, a human has to encode these high level concepts and their relationship into rules. These rules are encoded as if then statements.

**A bit about its history** 

Symbolic AI was the dominant form of AI until 1980s when statistical methods took over. The term artificial intelligence was coined at the seminal conference in 1956 at Dartmouth, organized by John McCarthy. The pioneers of the field John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky believed rule based system will ultimately lead to human level intelligence (Artificial General Intelligence) and beyond.  Symbolic AI is also often referred as ' 'Good Old Fashioned AI ' because of this historical context. There is an ongoing project called 'Cyc', one of the longest running that aims to codify all of the 'common sense knowledge' a human possesses, the hypothesis is that the system should eventually be able to reason like a human once this system has access to all common sense knowledge. 


**Why it failed to deliver on its promise ?**
Symbolic AI went out of fashion for two main reasons:

1. Hard coding a chain of rules for sufficiently complex tasks can be overwhelming and requires domain expertise.  
2. Rule based reasoning systems are not robust against noisy data.


**Finally, its resurgence or why do we need it again ?**
Statistical machine learning and its modern avatar deep learning (including deep reinforcement learning) has had a profound impact on our society. Almost autonomous cars, super human performance in GO and near perfect speech recognition is the result of deep learning and specialized hardware. However, these systems are also notoriously difficult to interpret. Imagine applying for loan

The term "unprecedented" has been repeated often in 2020. It’s a word
that has come to symbolize the chaos and disruption that has left many
people and companies in turmoil. Despite this, "unprecedented" does not
have to just have negative connotations though. There is the opportunity
to create unprecedented good in this world too. With **Arturo
Rodriguez** and I coming onboard to the DSAi community I think there is
an unprecedented opportunity and that is to have more amazing
conversations around the power of data and the technologies out there
than can turn raw information into powerful insights.

 

For those who don't know, DSAi was built from a collective of separate
data science communities and brought together thanks to
co-founders **Jacky Koh, Paul Steven Conyngham **and** Shuning Zhao**.
Over their short period of existence, they've grown from strength to
strength and we're going to continue developing the value that a
community like this can bring.

 

2020 has been a crazy year for people in many industries but data and
technology can be a catalyst to change and improve the world and give
people a chance to control the narrative. Whether you're a decision
maker, manager, analyst or someone just starting to get invovled in
data, then come check out DSAi and register your interest in the link
below so you too can become part of an amazing community.

We’re going to be focusing on 3 types of events that the data community
in Australia (and globally) can be a part and we’re looking forward to
those who can participate as well as those who have ideas for how they
can contribute to the conversation here.

 

The 3 event types are made to help facilitate conversations for
different levels of users. These range from **Getting Started **events
for the novice data analysts and those interested in getting started
to **Masterclasses **for the more senior and advanced people working
with data. Finally, we will also be catering towards the decision makers
on the data community and helping them understand the latest and
greatest goings on in the the world of data. Bringing all of these sorts
of people together in one place means we’ll all be talking the same
language and we hope will lead to more meaningful conversations about
data. When it comes to talking about data we want DSAi to be the place
to go to and we want to make sure everyone gets value from it.

 

**Event types**
---------------

-   **Getting Started** – these events are for those getting started and
    we will have speakers present examples of work that they have done.
    This ranges from crunching the numbers with data science tools like
    Python and R to visualization techniques in data analytics
    applications like Qlik, Tableau or Power BI.
-   **Masterclasses **– these events are geared towards more experienced
    people across different industries to talk about specific problems
    they’ve solved as well as coming together to help each other solve
    problems. There may be some data war stories or examples of how to
    get projects done better.
-   **Interviews and Roundtables **– this type of event brings in more
    of the decision makers and business end of the scale into the data
    conversation. Whilst a data community can get a lot done by
    collaborating with one another, we want to get more parts of the
    business into the conversation too so we can better understand their
    pain points and help each other with better ways of working. These
    interviews (and eventually roundtables) will help us understand
    that.

It's going to be an exciting period going forward for DSAi and we look
forward to being part of your data journey!
